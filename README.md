Hello! This is the second website I had ever made. I made it as an assignment for my degree. We had to think of a system, create it and compare it with the current system.  

This application is a java web app, it is used in a student accommodation scenario where it helps students find more affordable accommodation by changing the way the fees are set. Instead of creating a fixed rate in which the student needs to pay per period of time. This system will calculate the amount of time the student is in the facility and how much water &amp; electricity the student used up.
